BEFORE TRAINING THE MODEL:

-First, follow the directions in environment.yaml to create and activate the environment.

-Once the environment is successfully created, to change to it in VScode, ctrl + shift + P,
and then navigate to "Python: Select Interpreter". Choose 'nfl_score_prediction_env' from the list that appears.

-You will have to restart your terminal for it to account for the change in environment.

TO TRAIN THE MODEL:

-Run 'python model.py' in the terminal

TO TEST THE MODEL:

-Run 'python predict.py' in the terminal



CURRENT ISSUES:

-Could use feature reduction or maybe additional complexity in the net
